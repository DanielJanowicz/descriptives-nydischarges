## Issue with Tableone

> I was trying to include various columns of data into the groupby with tableone, however I ran into an issue where tableone could not read payment or description, which were set as objects.  However age, race, and admission type were also listed as an object.  I looked on stackoverflow and did not find anything that could help, since the terminal error was difficult to read.
