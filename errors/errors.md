## Issue with Tableone

> I was trying to include various columns of data into the groupby with tableone, however I ran into an issue where tableone could not read payment or description, which were set as objects.  However age, race, and admission type were also listed as an object.  I looked on stackoverflow and did not find anything that could help, since the terminal error was difficult to read.

I was searching online for a way to fix the problem, but I couldn't find any luck.  Maybe it's because I'm searching up the wrong things, I just don't know.  I also tried to go ahead and type out the code as if the function worked in order to calculate the mean, but I ran into more issues with an array and dictionary.  I don't want to say I gave up on it, but I tried to go through everything I could.  I added in other packages to try and fix the issue but that didn't work either.  I scheduled office hours to go over this.
